## Beginner Python Projects

Welcome to the summary of all the projects I completed from Kylie Ying's YouTube series on FreeCodeCamp. Please see below for more details

1. GuessTheNumber/GuessTheNumber-Computer - You have to guess the computers randomly generated number from within your chosen range

2. GuessTheNumber/GuessTheNumber-User - The computer has to guess your chosen number within your chosen range

3. RockPaperScissors - Play the famous game with the computer

4. Hangman/Hangman - Play Hangman with the computer

** Please Note - you need the HangmanWords file downloaded to play Hangman

5. TicTacToe/TicTacToeGame - Play Tic Tac Toe with the computer that will play it's positions randomly (easy)

6. TicTacToe/TicTacToeAI - Play Tic Tac Toe with the computer that uses an algorithm to ensure it never loses (WARNING! You will not win!!!)

** Please Note - you need to have the TicTacToePlayers file downloaded in order to play both versions of Tic Tac Toe

7. Searches/NaiveSearch - Enter a list of numbers and a target number and find out where in the list your target number is

8. Searches/BinarySearch - Compares times taken to search through a list of 10,000 random numbers in a Naive way and a Binary way 

9. Minesweeper - Play a command line version of the classic game

** Please Note - you have to finish the game (win or lose) to exit the programme

10. SudokuSolver - a function that will try every possible number in every postion on a given sudoku and solve it if it's solvable. It does this through recursion. It also therefore checks if a given puzzle is solvable

11. MarkovChainTextComposer - use the HarryPotterComposer to generate related text from the book using the Markov Chain principle

I did create 7. Searches/NaiveSearch myself
